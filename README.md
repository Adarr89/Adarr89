# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @Adarr89


My Name is James Burman. I am a first-year computer science student at Oxford Brookes University. I enjoy programming, reading, climbing, and learning languages. I can speak English and Spanish, and I can speak Portuguese conversationally. I am currently learning German. I am a reasonably capable Python programmer and have used other languages such as C#, C++, Java, and Lua.


## Some of my projects

### Word embedding de-biaser
This was a project that I worked on for a piece of coursework in my Sixth form education. Everyone knows what LLMs and generative AI are, and most people know that they work by predicting the next word in a sentence based on a topic. But they learn this from human data, leading to the inherent bias. With this project, I tackled the problem at the level of vector word embedding that looks to isolate and remove the dimension denoting gender for professional environment topics.

### Flight ticket price, web scraper
I still use this project. It's a simple program using Selenium and Beautifulsoup4 to scrape flight data from Google Flights and display cost, time of departure, airline, and travel time in a CSV file.

### Wav file to chords
This was a project that I made when I was fed up with not being able to find Guitar tabs for free online. Given an inputted WAV file, it breaks it up into samples of n beats in length. Then, it uses a Fourier analysis to find the most intense frequency in a given sample, returning that frequency as a note + octave combination. 
  - This project needs to be given some solid test cases to check how well it is working

### Rotating cube in C++
This was a fun project that I did, applying my knowledge of trigonometry to simulate a rotating cube in 3D space on a 2D plane.
